## Build

lei3d has originally been created using Visual Studio 2022 on Windows. It has been tested on other platforms, to compile, please follow the instructions below to use CMake to create a build for whatever system you are currently running on. 

### Windows
1) Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). Ensure to set Cmake available on path to all users.
2) Open CMake GUI tool. Select source code to be the root directory of this cloned repo
3) Create a new folder called 'build'. Set this to be where we build our binaries
4) Press generate
5) Open the generated sln file with Visual Studio 2022
6) Under the solution explorer, find lei3d. Right click and press build
7) Right click lei3d again, set it as the startup project. 
8) Run the project.

### Mac
1) Navigate to the project folder
2) Make a build folder `mkdir build`  
3) Enter the folder `cd build`
4) Compile your project `cmake ..`
5) Call `make`
6) cd `/src/engine`
7) `./lei3d`

### Linux
1) Navigate to the project folder
2) Make a build folder `mkdir build`  
3) Enter the folder `cd build`
4) Compile your project `cmake ..`
5) Call `make`
6) cd `/src/engine`
7) `./lei3d`

### Build Types
Depending on your needs with the engine, there are multiple ways you can build the engine. If you want to build a Debug build, include 
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` when you first run CMake. You can specify the same cmake parameter for Release builds.

# SkyLei - Surf The Sky Islands
![SkyLei logo](screenshots/SkyLei.png)

## Overview
[SkyLei](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ktms7R8Q_NFXl61THuaZg5ugdS3S1yB7YlfEAdG3e6E/edit) is a game that presents a unique twist in the world of speed running games by focusing on slowing down.

In a world that is shattered to pieces and taken to islands in the sky, SkyLei follows the exhilarating plight of Leilani Leaf through a colorless, once beautiful world. Primary gameplay consists of racing around and exploring a surreal-dreamlike world with physics-based movement. The levels of the world add new features that inspire new routes and discovery of the world. This adds challenge and enjoyment to players of any skill-level. At the very end of each level, Leilani brings color back to the world when she discovers the beauty of all that surrounds her.
